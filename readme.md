The Game is a Backbone based project which helps to use a Quests/Rewards system as a Game. For example: you've created a quest, assigned a reward. As soon as quest get's resolved, you will have a specified reward. 
Look very similar to a simple todo app with some extra features. 

Technologies used:

* Backbone with some Marionette mixins (I thought Marionette will solve a lot of problems, but it didn't)
* Bootstrap for look and feel (nice and smooth)
* Mongo DB + Mongoose to store the data
* Node and Express on a server side (actually Express is pretty old here)
* npm, bower, Gulp, yeoman to generate and automate everything

Project was developed for testing purposes, use anything from it on your own risk. Enjoy coding!
